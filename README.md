#NeRF or Nothing
##Creating Virtual Reality Videos through Neural Radiance Fields

Through learning about neural networks, current computer graphics techniques, PyTorch, and the strains of needing a RTX 4090/3090, you will develop Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). From there, you will take a look at the many different approaches to developing NeRFs under various contexts. You will synthesize your own process of creating a dynamic NeRF through your own understanding in ideally a room-scale environment, which can be accessible through a virtual reality interface.

Dr. Xiaohu Guo (https://cs.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/guo-xiaohu/)

###Research Plan Summary
For Week 1-2, you will get familiar with the core concepts of research, computer graphics’ volume rendering and view synthesis, the basics of neural networks, the feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), the relevant class of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), backpropagation, setting up development environments, and then a brief understanding of the concepts that make up Neural Radiance Fields. We will accomplish this through practice using PyTorch’s Neural Network implementation through Google Colab, Miniconda and Ubuntu Virtual Machines, and observing the composition of current 3D Voxel rendering, raytracting, and by creating stationary NeRFs using end-user applications (Instant-NGP, LumaAI). Here we will also establish rules, getting every team member on the same level of knowledge, and re-evaluating the path of the research project moving forward in a realistic scope.

From Week 3-5, you will be constantly building up and demonstrating your knowledge base of the many different relevant implementations of Neural Radiance Fields. This includes creating a NeRF neural network from scratch using PyTorch, adapting them as a function over time for dynamic NeRFs (D-NeRFs), and then replicating relevant research papers in VR and large/room-scale applications. You will work in-depth with your faculty advisor and his research group at this stage to gain a greater understanding of the technology. You may also leverage tools such as NVIDIA’s Kaolin Wisp and COLMAP.

For Week 6-10, you will demonstrate your understanding of Neural Networks, Computer Graphics, Neural Radiance Fields, the Research Process, Development Environments into creating a dynamic neural radiance field over a room-scale view. You will plan days to meet and gather the dataset needed for public presentation. You will encounter the current problems and limitations of current NeRF implementations such as computing large-scale view-synthesis and positioning, datasets, optimizing for time, and then collaborating on how to solve them. You will also start compiling the knowledge base and citations into a comprehensive public paper, poster, slides, and presentation for the Symposium using LaTEX and Zotero.
